Linear Program Solver
A Windows application for solving and visualizing linear programming problems using the simplex method and graphical method.

Purpose
This program helps users:

Easily solve linear programming (LP) problems (maximize/minimize an objective function under constraints).

See both algebraic (simplex) and graphical solutions for 2-variable problems.

Learn and visualize LP feasible regions, optimal points, and simplex tableau steps.

How It Works
Enter your objective function (e.g. 600x + 400y).

Enter your constraints on separate lines (e.g. 2x + y <= 2000, 4x + 8y <= 8000, etc.).

Select whether you want to maximize or minimize your objective.

Click Solve Problem.

The solver will:

Use simplex or linprog to find the optimal solution.

Show a step-by-step simplex tableau (for simple <= constraints).

Plot the graphical solution and all constraint boundaries (for 2-variable problems), highlighting the optimal vertex.

How To Use
Download and run LinearProgramSolver.exe from the Releases tab.

Use the graphical interface:

Type the objective function in the first box.

Enter each constraint on a new line in the constraints box.

Choose Maximize or Minimize from the dropdown.

Press Solve Problem.

View the results:

Optimal solution variables and Z value.

Simplex trace (if applicable).

Interactive plot for 2-variable problems, showing constraint lines and the feasible region.

Requirements
Windows 10/11

No installation needed; just run the .exe file.

Created for students, researchers, and professionals needing fast and visual LP solutions.
